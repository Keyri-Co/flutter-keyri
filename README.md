## About

This is a package for Flutter mobile apps to support the [Keyri QR login system](https://keyri.com). Full documentation can be found here: https://docs.keyri.com/flutter.

The plugin is based on the Keyri iOS (Swift) and Android (Kotlin) packages, which require iOS 14+ and Android API level 23+ to work, respectively. Neither package has any third-party dependencies.
